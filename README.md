# Basic_Calculator
This Python script implements a basic command-line calculator that prompts the user for input, performs arithmetic operations, and displays the result. The script guides the user through a series of inputs to determine the type of calculation (integer or float), the numbers to be operated on, and the desired arithmetic operation.
